# SurviveAmsterdam

Work in progress toy project, to show how it is possible to build a complete
application (mobile and [API services](https://github.com/darthpelo/SurviveAmsterdam-backend)) only with Swift :)

[Here](https://github.com/darthpelo/SurviveAmsterdam/tree/swift2.3) the Swift 2.3 version.
